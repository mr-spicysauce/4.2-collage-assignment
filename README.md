# Why program in Godot?

I am very bad at coding but I have used Godot many times to make games and demos. I think it would be a fun challenge
as it's not meant for programs but for games. Also I wanted to make a GUI for the program and not use CLI like everyone
else is doing in the course. Also I had some plans for some really cool animations for the program in the Events and Ranks tab but I am running out of time!

# How to install edit and run?

### Edit Program

This was coded using Godot 3.4.5 as it is what I had on my USB at collage and I couldn't be asked to switch to a different version.
Download Godot 3.4.5 and open the project using the project manager. When inside the editor the test data will be in **res://**
however when the program is ran it will save the actual data to %APPDATA%\Godot\app_userdata\ (this file will appear when it's ran for the first time)
So after running it by pressing f6 or the arrow in the top right drag the test data into the **app_userdata** or make new data file when registering new teams etc.

### Instal and run

If you don't want the ability to edit the program and be offended by my horrifically written code at 4:47am then you can head on over to the release's on the repository and download the latest version and follow the better written install instructions there!
